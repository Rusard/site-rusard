# AGENTS.md — site-rusard

This repository's main usage instructions are defined in `rusard_site/agent_pack_site_rusard/AGENTS.md`. That file outlines how ChatGPT agents should work on this project, including:

- Operate without network access.
- Run the sequence `scripts/format.sh` → `scripts/lint.sh` → `scripts/test.sh` before committing.
- Avoid modifying secrets and keep changes minimal.

The scripts mentioned above live under `rusard_site/agent_pack_site_rusard/scripts/`.

## Subdirectory AGENTS files
- `rusard_site/agent_pack_site_rusard/AGENTS.md` — contains the detailed guidelines referenced here.
- No other subdirectories currently contain an `AGENTS.md`.
